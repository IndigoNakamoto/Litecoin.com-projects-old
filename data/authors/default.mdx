Lite.Space is an initiative under the umbrella of the Litecoin Foundation, Inc., based in Singapore (UEN: 201709179W). As a public charity, our cardinal aim is to channel funds towards projects rooted in Litecoin that champion free, open-source ethos, as well as to bolster educational and research undertakings.

## Our Vision

We envision a robust, self-sustaining ecosystem that provides consistent support to contributors to Litecoin and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) tools. Our ambition is to ensure that innovative projects within the Litecoin community receive the necessary resources to flourish and contribute to the public's access to Litecoin infrastructure.

## Our Platform

To actualize this vision, we've developed a dedicated platform, Lite.Space, where donors can extend their support. Through Lite.Space, donors can direct their contributions to specific project areas or contribute to our general fund, creating a wave of support that pushes the Litecoin community and open-source projects forward.
