# Apply for a Grant

The Litecoin Foundation FOSS Council is always on the lookout for new and innovative projects that align with our mission to support and maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects, particularly those related to Litecoin.

If you're working on an open-source project that could use some financial support, we'd love to hear from you. We provide grants to projects that:

- Contribute to the development of new Litecoin or Litecoin-adjacent software.
- Work on improving existing free and open-source software that is important to the Litecoin ecosystem.
- Promote education and outreach about Litecoin.
- Conduct research into Litecoin-related topics.

Our goal is to help make Litecoin more accessible, robust, secure, and decentralized, and we believe that supporting open-source projects is one of the best ways to achieve this.
