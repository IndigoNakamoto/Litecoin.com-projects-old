## Thanks for your interest in Lite.Space!

We're incredibly grateful to contributors like you working to support Litecoin,
and other free and open-source projects.

Because Lite.Space is a [501(c)(3) non-profit][about], all applications must be
vetted by our board of directors to ensure that they help us further our
[mission] of supporting contributors to Litecoin and related free and
open-source projects.

Additionally, Lite.Space must support specific PROJECTS which help to further our
charitable mission. As such, if you are an individual contributor, please be
sure that you list a SPECIFIC PROJECT you are working on.

The information collected below will be used in order to vet your project. If
approved, Lite.Space will create a project page on our [projects page][pp] where
visitors can learn more about your project and donate if they choose to. Your
project will be listed for one year. After one year, you will be prompted to
re-send your application should you wish to be listed again.

We also distribute grants from our [general fund][gf] and you may also choose to
apply for a grant below.

## Criteria

Litecoin: We prioritize projects that will have a direct impact on the utility or
adoption of Litecoin. We will consider all projects but prefer projects that are
not readily funded and which have an obvious benefit to the Litecoin community
and ecosystem. Potential projects include Litecoin Core contributions,
scientific/security research, code review, design/UX improvements, etc.

Free and Open-Source: Lite.Space supports free and open-source software, tools,
and contributors which complement Litecoin and help Litecoin reach its
fullest potential. Potential areas of interest include secure messaging,
merchant acceptance tools, layer two protocols, etc. Source code and documents
resulting from funded projects must be made publicly available for access, edit,
and redistribution free of charge and without restrictions.

Education and Mentorship: Funded contributors and projects should be prepared to
share their experience and expertise with the greater community. We prefer
developers who actively engage in mentorship, and help introduce Litecoin
software development to newcomers.

If your project is selected to be listed, we will reach out with any additional
information necessary to ensure you are able to receive donation payouts. This
may include tax related information depending on your location and/or Litecoin
addresses in order to receive donation payouts from Lite.Space.
